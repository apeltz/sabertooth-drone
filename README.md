# Web Bluetooth Parrot Mini Drone Controller

Controlling a Parrot Mini Drone from Chrome for Android, using [Web Bluetooth](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web?hl=en).

## Setup

Currently requires Chrome for Android Dev edition, with the [Web Bluetooth flag enabled](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web#before-we-start).

Run the web app up on your dev machine with: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`

Go to [chrome://inspect/#devices](chrome://inspect/#devices) and enable port forwarding for port 8080.
Now you should be able to visit `localhost:8080` on your Android device, to see the dashboard. 

NB. You can't just point to an IP address because Web Bluetooth requires HTTPS, if not serving from `localhost`. 

If you have trouble debugging in the standard Chrome version, try Chrome Canary (it worked better for me).

It's currently configured for a "Travis" (Airborne Cargo) drone, but you can switch the type of mini drone to look
for - see `DRONE_BLUETOOTH_NAME_PREFIX` at the top of app.js.   

## Safety warning

This code isn't bullet proof, the Web Bluetooth API is not stable and the Dev edition of Chrome for Android is, well,
the Dev edition... Please observe the usual caution as well as making sure you have a backup method of 
disabling the drone in the event of a bug (a technique I have used is to raise something like a strong piece of card
up towards the drone from underneath. When it detects it has been touched, the drone should shut down automatically).

## Then...

* Ensure the drone is switched on and the lights are green.

* Press the 'Connect' button.

* Select your drone name to pair with.

* Now you're in control! Try Take Off, Flip and Land.  

## Troubleshooting

Unfortunately it is a bit flaky, presumably because it's an experimental API. For the best chance of success,
close and re-open Chrome for Android Dev first (plus reload the page if you made changes). Having the remote debugging 
tools open in Chrome Canary seems like it may help too (it will help you to see where it's going wrong, at least).
If that still fails, try switching the drone off and on again, wait for the green lights, and then try the above again.

If you spot any fixes / improvements that could be made, PRs are very welcome!
